# Flutter Firebase app on BLoC Architecture

A Flutter project to demonstrate the BLoC implementation of a flutter app using Firebase as a backend.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view
[Flutter online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## About Project

This project is the demo of the BLoC architecture of flutter app developement, using Firebase as
backend. Basically BLoC stand for Business(B) Logic(Lo) Component(C). It is developed by Felix Angelov.

BLoC allow developers to write business logic code separately from the main UI code in reactive
manner. Also when we are using BLoC then it is intended that we don't have to use flutter's own
setState(() {}) method to update the state. Here for updating the state of the widget we create
different states, their respective events and business logic associated with it. Although all these
things will be written down in separate files.

Seems exciting :yum: ?...Please have a look into project.

HAPPY FLUTTERING :heart_eyes: :heart_eyes:
