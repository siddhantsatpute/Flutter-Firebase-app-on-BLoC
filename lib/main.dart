///This project is the demo of the BLoC architecture of flutter app developement, using Firebase as
///backend. Basically BLoC stand for Business(B) Logic(Lo) Component(C). It is developed by Felix Angelov.

///BLoC allow developers to write business logic code separately from the main UI code in reactive
///manner. Also when we are using BLoC then it is intended that we don't have to use flutter's own
///setState(() {}) method to update the state. Here for updating the state of the widget we create
///different states, their respective events and business logic associated with it. Although all these
///things will be written down in separate files.
